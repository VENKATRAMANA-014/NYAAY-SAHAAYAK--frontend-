        <h3>Energy law</h3>
        In India, the fundamental enactments that govern both the renewable energy and non- renewable energy are the Electricity Act, 2003 (Amended up to date) and the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. The basic objective of the Electricity Act is to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading, and use of electricity and to take measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas. It aims to rationalize electricity tariffs,
         ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies and promoting efficient and environmentally benign policies. It also provided for institutional framework in terms of constitution of Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions, and establishment of Appellate Tribunal. On the other hand, the second enactment of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 deals with legal mandates for the efficient use of energy and its conservation. The Rules made under these Central enactments form the backbone of the enforcement of energy laws in India.

As the non-renewable energy resources are getting depleted and contributing more towards multiple climate related issues, the Indian government brought out multiple policies to promote usage of renewable energy sources. These Policies and Guidelines also form the part of Energy Laws Framework in India.

The National Electricity Policy which was implemented in 2005 aimed at formulating guidelines for accelerated development of the power sector, providing supply of electricity to all areas and technology available to tap these resources, economics of generation using different resources, and energy security issues, special focus was laid on the utilization of maximum hydro potential in the country[3]. The Tariff Policy, amended from time to time,
 is developed to secure optimum utilization of both conventional and non-conventional sources. Further, the Integrated Energy Policy of 2006 focused on efficient integration, planning, and forecasting for optimal utilization of available energy resources in India with a focus on nuclear and non-conventional sources of energy to meet the energy demand for sustainable development[4].
