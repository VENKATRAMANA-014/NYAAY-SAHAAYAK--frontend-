        <h3>Hindu law</h3>

        Indian law, the legal practices and institutions of India. The general history of law in India is a well-documented case of reception as well as of grafting. Foreign laws have been “received” into the Indian subcontinent—for example, in the demand by the Hindus of Goa for Portuguese civil law; and the enactment by independent India of statutes such as the Estate Duty Act (1953), the Copyright Act (1957), and the Merchant Shipping Act (1958), 
        which substantially reproduce English models. Foreign laws have also frequently been “grafted” upon indigenous laws, as is seen in both Anglo-Muslim and Hindu law. 
        Legal institutions introduced by foreign governments were accepted readily by the Indians, either because they were compatible with existing trends or because they met new needs. Independence in 1947 brought an intensification of these processes.
        Hindu law is thought to be divine law. God revealed it to humans through the Vedas. The notion of life described in the Vedas has been extended and polished by different phases and ascetics. Ancient Hindu legislators were not monarchs, but sages, who could be considered semi-divine individuals due to their deep intellectual speculation and foresight, as well as strong sympathy for man-to-man social dealings.

It was these thinkers who established Hindu law, which can be found in the dharmasutras, dharmashastras, and the Artha sastra of Kautilya as explained and elaborated by various nibandhas and later era commentary.[6] The concept of "the rule of law" was acknowledged from the outset in ancient India. Hindu law dates back roughly 6000 years[7].



The origins of these legal and religious speculations must be traced back to the Vedic Deity Varuna's idea of Rita, or Natural Order. From the previous brief historical outline, it is clear that Hindu law was initially territorial in nature, applying to all residents of Aryavarta or India. However, after the arrival of the Muslims, it could no longer be considered to be downright territorial; it was now limited to the Hindu community alone.
