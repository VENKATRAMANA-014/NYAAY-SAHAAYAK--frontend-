        <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
        Law enforcement in India is imperative to keep justice and order in the nation. Indian law is enforced by a number of agencies. Unlike many federal nations, the constitution of India delegates the maintenance of law and order primarily to the states and territories.[1]

At the federal level, some of India's paramilitary forces are part of the Ministry of Home Affairs and support the states. Larger cities have their own police forces under their respective state police (except the Kolkata Police that is autonomous and reports to state's Home Secretary).
 All senior officers in the state police forces and federal agencies are members of the Indian Police Service (IPS).[citation needed]India has some special tactical forces both on the federal and state level to deal with terrorist attacks like Mumbai Police Quick Response Team, National Security Guard, Anti-Terrorism Squad, Delhi Police SWAT, etc.
