        <h3>International law</h3>
        International Law is known to us by different names such as Inter-State Law, Law of Nations and Public International Law and has many definitions. In addition to this, international law has a traditional as well as a modern definition and there are different versions of these definitions. According to the traditional language, international law is a set of laws and rules and regulations that regulate the relations amongst various countries.

The modern definition of international law has not changed so much. According to the modern definition, international law is a set of laws and rules and regulations that regulate the relations amongst different countries and the relations amongst various distinct international organizations, individual non-state entities, and companies. Unlike the law of the land or National Law, international law does not have a recognized legislature, judiciary or executive.

We know that the Local Law or the National law consists of all of the three i.e., legislature, executive and judiciary but international law does not. John Austin has defined international law as a code of rules and conduct of moral force or nature. On the contrary, Hall and Lawrence call international law a true law.

They believe that international law is derived from customs and precedents which happen to be a source of law. In addition to this, they also believe that international law is treated as a specific kind of positive law. We shall be discussing how international law is enforced in India.
