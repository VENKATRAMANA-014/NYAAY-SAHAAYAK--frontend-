        <h3>Statutory law</h3>
        The statutory law definition is the class of laws formally enacted by a legislature. In the United States, statutory laws, or statutes, can be enacted at the state level by state legislatures and signed by the Governor or by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.
         So who makes statute laws? Minimally, statute laws are made by some legislative body, which can vary greatly with context. Moreover, statutes are passed by the legislative body and often approved by an executive officer.
Statute laws are codified, meaning organized within a general system of laws. One feature of the codification of laws in the United States is that federal statutory laws have higher precedence over state statutory laws. Moreover,
 statutes are codified into public and private law.Statutory law in India refers to laws that are created and enacted by the legislative branch of the government. These laws are formally written and codified, and they cover a wide range of subjects, from criminal offenses to civil matters, taxation, and administrative procedures. Statutory laws in India are enacted by the Parliament of India at the central level and by the State Legislatures at the state level.
