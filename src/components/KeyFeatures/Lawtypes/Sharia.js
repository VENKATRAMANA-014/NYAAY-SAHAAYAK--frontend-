        <h3>Sharia law</h3>
        In India, the term Muslim law applies to the personal matters concerning that section of the Indian society composed of people following Islam. Hence the Muslim personal law governs the institutions of marriage and divorce, adoption, succession and charity in the Indian Islamic community. The Muslim personal law governs the institutions of marriage and divorce, adoption, succession and charity in the Indian Islamic community.

Uniform Civil Code as the term itself suggests aims to codify the currently existing diverse communal laws into single overriding legislation in accordance with the fundamental principles enshrined in the Indian Constitution. However, the introduction of the code is fraught with several difficulties as these different that we currently in vogue originates in the religious statutes and several sections of the society especially the minority communities feel that it will eventually turn out to be a guise under which they will be subjected to the majority communitys norms.

This probability for the development of potential friction between one community and the mainstream society is especially pronounced in the Muslim world, where a unique codified judicial system which evolved out of the special Social-cultural norms and religious beliefs of the community, unlike their compatriots belonging to other religious groups. This endemic judicial system is popularly known as the Sharia law which is the governing legislation in most of those countries who has made Islam their state religion such as Afghanistan Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Though Islam is considered monolithic religion divisions exist on the basis of several sub sectarian practices. The most widely known of such a division Is between the Schools of Shia and Sunni. Correspondingly, the Islamic law as practised in these communities exhibits subtle variations.
    
Sharia law, also known as Islamic law, is a system of legal principles derived from the Quran and Hadith, the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. In India, Sharia law applies primarily to the Muslim community in matters related to personal law, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and family disputes. The application of Sharia law is not uniform, as it coexists with the secular legal system. In matters of personal law, Muslims in India have the option to follow Sharia principles, and Sharia courts, known as "Qazis" or "Dar-ul-Qaza,"
 may assist in resolving disputes based on Islamic jurisprudence.
 However, decisions of Sharia courts are subject to the Constitution of India, and they do not have the power to override secular laws. The relationship between Sharia law and the Indian legal system is a complex and evolving aspect, where efforts are made to balance the principles of religious freedom and constitutional rights.
